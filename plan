BEGINNER
simplest
proximity (works with several talkers)
several statements (without textasset)
several statements (with textasset)
introducing names and faces

INTERMEDIATE
working with the state machine!! :O
- theory of a state machine? (do by hand what the state machine has to do automatically)
- modular scripts that interactuate with the state machine
  - OnReadGoToNext (int index)
  - OnVisitedGoTo (visitedPlace, destinationIndex)
    - prove that it is easy to extend!!
      - OnTalkedGoTo (talker talked to, dialogue talked, destination dialogue index)

ADVANCED
working in multi scenes
- the difficulties, the need of persistence (the need of a DialogueController), and an introduction to dictionaries
- pointers and the problem on the dictionary
- talkers that remember it's state (dialogue controller as singleton?)
- visited places that remember being visited
- player that remembers visited places.
- prove that it is easy to extend by extending it to OnTalkedGoTo
